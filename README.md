# adventure_game
A text adventure game for primary school children.

## ToDo
- refactor html to use gamestate, not data attributes
- replace all referancs to "step" and replace with "page"
- style inputs
- kill type function when buttons pressed
- background colour black
- build jump to step function so debugging this bastard isn't the worst
- think of name
